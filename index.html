		<div>My story

		<div>I’ve always loved how brilliant flowers look but I’ve hated how they never last very long even if you spend lots of time caring for them. So I have created plastic coated flowers which you can wear as earrings or necklaces, you still get the brilliant looks of the flowers but none of the hassle of having to take care of them. They also last much longer than normal flowers.</div>
